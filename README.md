## How to Play
1. Click on any of the empty cells to mark it with your symbol (`X` or `O`).
2. Alternates between player and the computer until someone wins or the board is full.
3. The current player's turn is displayed at the top of the board.
4. If a player wins, the game will announce the winner and disable further moves.
5. If the board is full without a winner, the game will declare a draw.
6. Press the **Reset Game** button to start a new round.
7. Use the **Toggle Dark Mode** button to switch between light and dark themes.

### Winning Patterns
- Any row, column, or diagonal with the same symbol wins the game.

### Customization
- **Dark/Light Mode**: You can toggle between modes using the "Toggle Dark Mode" button. The preference is stored in `localStorage` and persists even after you close the browser.
- **Styling**: You can customize the appearance further by modifying the `style.css` file.
- **Game Board Size**: Currently, the board is 3x3, but you can expand or modify the grid size by updating the `createBoard()` function in `script.js`.
